              Tailwind Turmoil: Why I Still Write CSS Like It's 2015
          </h1>

          <p class="blog__date">March 2025</p>


          <div class="blog__chat_chat-container">

            <div class="blog__chat_msg blog__chat_user">Every time I touch front-end work, someone’s in my ear: <em>“You using Tailwind, bro?”</em> I don’t hate Tailwind, but I definitely don’t love it either. When given the choice, I usually prefer to stick with traditional CSS approaches that I know and trust. The thing is, I’m comfortable with CSS. I’ve spent years working with it, learning its quirks, and understanding how to use tools like Flexbox and Grid effectively.</div>
          
            <div class="blog__chat_msg blog__chat_charla">Why waste time naming classes and jumping between files? Tailwind keeps me in my HTML, styles fast, stays consistent, and just works. I haven’t opened a style.css in 3 years, and I’m thriving, bro. Tailwind's not a CSS library—it's a <em>vibe</em>.</div>
          
            <div class="blog__chat_msg blog__chat_user">Yeah, I guess you have less context-switching, but your markup looks like a keyboard smashed itself. The only place inline styles make some sense to me is in a React-based project—I mean, JSX is already sorta gross-looking, so why not toss inline styles into the mix?</div>
          
            <div class="blog__chat_msg blog__chat_charla">Look, my semantic stylesheet sorcerer. I ship UIs in minutes, not hours. No dead CSS, no specificity hell, no mental context-switch. Utility-first = faster flow. For real, one of the great things about Tailwind is that it avoids all namespace clashing by design—each class does one thing, so there are no global side effects.</div>
          
            <div class="blog__chat_msg blog__chat_user">Well yeah... you sidestep the original sin of CSS: global scope. However, I can't say it's a problem that troubles me too much; with careful design, it's a non-issue. I mean, that's why we have BEM and modular CSS.</div>
          
            <div class="blog__chat_msg blog__chat_charla">BEM? Listen here, my class-conscious code poet. Why name your styles like a Victorian librarian when you can just build your UI like a street racer with a nail gun? Why build bikesheds like <code>btn__inverse--danger-alt-x</code> when Tailwind elegantly solves the problems of naming things, structuring things, and easily coordinating across teams?</div>
          
            <div class="blog__chat_msg blog__chat_user">Okay. I get it. It’s convenient when the whole team’s marching to the same Tailwind tune—I won't deny that efficiency. But when it’s just me and my code? I’m reaching for that sweet, pure, vanilla CSS. I might even sprinkle in some SCSS just to watch the utility-class cult twitch. See, I've already learned CSS. I’m not tossing that knowledge over my shoulder just because the new kids are too impatient to learn how <code>z-index</code> actually works. Are the fundamentals optional now? Nope—they’re not.</div>
          
            <div class="blog__chat_msg blog__chat_charla">Well, aren’t you adorable with your lovingly hand-written stylesheets and decade-old SCSS rituals. But some of us are out here shipping products, not polishing our specificity chains. You wanna whisper sweet nothings to your <code>.nav__item--is-active</code> class? Be my guest. I’ll be six commits ahead, deploying a full UI with a single line of <code>class=""</code> like a sorcerer with a hotkey addiction. You love CSS? That’s cute. But I’m out here living in the future. Tailwind isn’t a crutch—it’s a rocket launcher, and you’re still hand-crafting arrows.</div>
          
            <div class="blog__chat_msg blog__chat_user">CSS isn’t dead—it’s just sipping espresso while everyone else panic-installs plugins. Old heads like me will still be styling with CSS long after Tailwind has been replaced by whatever shiny new framework Gen Z starts tweeting about next.</div>
          
            <div class="blog__chat_msg blog__chat_charla">Sure, CSS is the foundation—but Tailwind is how we build faster, cleaner, and more consistently on top of it. It’s not about skipping fundamentals—it’s about scaling them. You can sip espresso with your handcrafted styles—I’ll be shipping production-ready UIs before the cup gets cold.</div>

            <div class="blog__chat_msg blog__chat_user">Alright, alright—I get it. Tailwind’s not going anywhere. At the end of the day, tools are just tools. As long as they help me build clean, functional interfaces, I’m good. Just don’t expect me to stop writing CSS anytime soon.</div>

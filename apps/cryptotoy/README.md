# CryptoToy

This is a small web app that does simple, archaic alphabetic text encryptions. Presently it does the [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) and the [Vignere cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher).

This app uses the [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) library of web components.
